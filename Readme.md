# Roctopus-client
This is a minimal working example of a client for Roctopus. Currently has severe drawbacks.

# Urgent to-do:
* Pack the dependencies: PyQt5 and socketIO-client.
* Implement task requesting and running functions in threads.
* `import` procedure needs optimization for faster start-up.

# How to use?

First you will need to install dependencies:

* Python 3.6
* [PyQt5](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyQt5)
* [socketIO-client](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/socketIO-client)

Then open up a command line and run `python main.py`.
