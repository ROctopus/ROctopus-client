# what?
This is the client for the rocto distributed computing cluster, a free and easy-to-use alternative to expensive and complex high-performance cluster computers.

The client facilitates two main features of rocto. If you want to get your job done by others in the cluster, client enables you to upload the workload you created using [rocto-rpackage.](https://github.com/roctoproject/rocto-rpackage) You can also help others get their jobs done by requesting tasks and running them simply with clicking around!

# when?

If you are up for a messy installation, any time! For others, easy to install packages for Linux and Windows are high up on our to-do list.

# how?

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the repository directory.
3. Make sure all went well :)
4. Run `python3 ROctopus_client/Qt/gui.py`.
5. If you want to play around, make sure you have a [rocto-server](https://github.com/roctoproject/rocto-server) running.
